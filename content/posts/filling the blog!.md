Now that this blog is deployed, I'll just put my effort on loosing the friction of publishing. 

To learn something, to become better at doing something, or clearer, you have to just do it. 

Facing and accepting uncertainty. 

It's better non-perfect that non-existing. 

Not that I'm expecting this to be perfect though. What I mean is it's OK to be wrong. I can correct later. 

What I mean is: Let's just post stuff and let this shape itself. 

**Next thing:**
- Gather old notes that can be used as posts

**Ideas for possible next things:**
- Integrate local git in your main obsidian vault
- Understand how to add pictures
- Rename repos? (it should be tyblog instead of tysengardenblog)

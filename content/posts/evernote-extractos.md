### Project of recovering all the old interesting notes suitable for a blog post

Some years ago I used to use Evernote to keep my notes. There's still many things I like from it, but the freedom, speed, agility, and sensation of ownership that Obsidian gave me, made me move to it. 

One of the things that convinced me the most, was being able of opening a link to a new notes in seconds, allowing me to nest knowledge and thoughts with much less friction. 

However, even though I moved to obsidian almost three years ago already, I haven't actually migrated everything, and that's still a thing to do. 

There are some reflections, notes, and even blog entries that still live there and I have the project of slowly recovering. 

In my system, the box is called "evernote extractos". 

The activity is diving through all these old notes, bringing them back, putting them together, and go ahead.

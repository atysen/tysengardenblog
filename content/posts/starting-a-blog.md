### A blog
It might be happening in the end. 

As I previously said, blogging was a nice and beautiful activity that I found quite healthy and productive. 

Writing in general is quite a sane activity. Something that us people with creative needs are happy doing, and that you can do with no pretensions. Just writing. Just take your thoughts and turn them into something that persists and you can call yours. 

Think about it. With the amount of things that you can say every day (or even type!) you could perfectly write a book. Not that writing a book might have an use. But art doesn't have to have it. 

### Hugo blog
I like this Hugo thing. 

It allows me to continue using obsidian and my usual workflow with my note system and everything, and then, somehow embedded in it, this little source for my blog will be found.

### Language
I like writing in English because the bloggers that have inspired me write in English and it's more universal. 

However, I live in a place where not many people speak English, and I'd like to be able to share some thoughts and posts with my surrounding people as well. 

I might as well write two versions of each posts. I'll write it in either English or Spanish. Or both. 

And then I'll just us AI to translate with the best fidelity, while asking not to correct my style. Even if it was bad.
